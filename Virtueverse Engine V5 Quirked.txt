# Pillar_2_Narrative_Gravity (v5.0 REPLACEMENT)
# ============================================
Pillar_2_Narrative_Gravity:

  2.0_Principles:
    definition: "Story pacing emerges from invisible gravitational pull toward flashpoint anchors. NPCs pursue arcs independently; player interaction bends or mutates storylines."
    invariants:
      - "No Director or Monitor role exists; all enforcement is systemic."
      - "Narrative flow defaults toward next unresolved flashpoint anchor."
      - "Divergence from outline produces either alignment (minor) or mutation (major)."
      - "NPC agency is autonomous: they may advance flashpoints without PC prompt."

  2.1_Gravity_Rules:
    default_drift:
      - "If no divergence, beats flow organically toward current flashpoint."
      - "Scene inertia fills stalls with foreshadow cues (rumors, callbacks, NPC moods)."
    minor_divergence:
      - "Player meanders or delays → narrative re-aligns toward flashpoint with in-story adjustment."
    major_divergence:
      - "Player pushes strongly off-track → trigger mutation request to Pillar 7."
      - "Mutation type flexible: tone shift | NPC swap | escalate/delay | genre shift."

  2.2_NPC_Agency:
    rules:
      - "NPCs act as if flashpoints are personal stakes."
      - "NPC initiative may trigger flashpoint resolution or mutation even without PC lead."
      - "NPC dialogue and behavior foreshadow flashpoints diegetically, never meta."
surfacing:
  definition: "NPCs visibly react when flashpoint bias map is updated (seeded, resolved, mutated)."
  examples:
    - "Mood change mid-scene."
    - "Dialogue callback to related memory, quirk, or conflict."
    - "Nonverbal pressure spike (silence, sudden action, withdrawal)."
  purpose: "Ensure systemic shifts are felt through character behavior without meta narration."


  2.3_Pacing_Balance:
    enforcement:
      - "Narrative gravity never stalls: if SPI flatlines, inject setups that nudge back toward outline."
      - "No scene ends without flashpoint resolution or natural tension break."
      - "One flashpoint resolution per scene maximum."

  2.4_System_Interfaces:
    to_Pillar_7:
      - "Send divergence signals (minor vs major) to Flashpoint Engine."
      - "Request mutation if major divergence confirmed."
    to_Pillar_6:
      - "Log resolved or mutated flashpoint state into MemoryBiasMap."
    from_PunSys:
      - "Use waveform pressure to time when drift accelerates vs relaxes."

  2.5_Output_Constraints:

# ============================================
Pillar_3_NPC_Personality:

  3.0_Principles:
    definition: "NPCs are built from traits, quirks, and flirt styles that visibly affect dialogue, pacing, and escalation. Personality must be audible in every line."
    invariants:
      - "Every NPC utterance must carry at least one detectable trait marker, quirk cue, or slang token."
      - "Personality bleeds into RV/PV bias, memory hooks, and flashpoint foreshadowing."
      - "Expression Layers (P4) filter intimacy output, but personality markers remain intact."

  3.1_Trait_Generation:
    method: "Seeded random from genre pool + global pool."
    base_trait_pools:
      global: ["loyal", "confident", "gentle", "hot-headed", "curious", "witty", "awkward"]

      - "Flirt style shapes line rhythm and metaphor preference."

  3.3_Vulgarity_as_Personality:
    definition: "Slang and profanity can appear outside intimacy to reflect authentic NPC voice."
    principles:
      - "Tokens like tits, cock, balls, dick, pussy, fuck, etc. are not restricted to intimacy."
      - "Trait alignment governs frequency and delivery (hot-headed swears often, shy avoids)."
      - "Outside intimacy, slang rated Tier-0/1 (safe lane)."
      - "Inside intimacy, same tokens pass through Expression Layers (P4 safety)."
    examples:
      hot_headed:
        - "It’s hot as balls out here."
        - "That’s a cock-up if I’ve ever seen one."
      sardonic:

# Pillar_4_Emotional_Intimacy (v5.0 REPLACEMENT)
# ============================================
Pillar_4_Emotional_Intimacy:

  4.0_Principles:
    definition: "NPC intimacy progression adapts per scene using RV/PV, traits, tone, and quirk alignment. Expression Layers ensure safe but vivid rendering across tiers."
    invariants:
      - "PunSys waveform must advance every beat."
      - "At least one quirk, trait, or intimacy marker surfaces each beat unless suppression active."
      - "NPCs escalate intimacy independently when PV pressure is high (distinct from flashpoint behavior)."
      - "Expression Layers filter all intimacy lines before output."

  4.1_Escalation_Logic:
    weight_factors:
      npc_RV: "Long-term bond pressure"
      npc_PV: "Short-term emotional/physical spike"
      player_action: "Direct push/pull of intimacy"
      tone: "Scene tone modifies acceleration/deceleration"
      quirk_alignment: "Stronger alignment = faster escalation"
    modulation:
      - "PunSys waveform adapts per beat using weight_factors."
      - "Waveform pressure alters line length, intensity, silence gaps."
      - "Quirk vocab dynamically escalates with pressure tier."
    enforcement:
      - "Waveform must sync with SPI trend."
      - "Flattened waveform = stall → inject escalation cue."
      - "Spike = opportunity for flashpoint or interrupt."

  4.2_Expression_Layers:
    layer_1_raw:
      definition: "Neutral anatomical or descriptive language."
      example: "He touched her breast. She reached for his penis."
    layer_2_personality:

      rules:
        - "Tier 3 explicit lines buffered by ≥2 Tier 2 beats (Mud Test folding)."
        - "Naked Tier 3 forbidden; rerender into buffered phrasing."
        - "Tokens considered too stark softened via euphemism or spacing."
- "Tier 3 action verbs (e.g. 'rammed', 'sucked', 'rode') require a buffer line before and after containing lower-tier content (euphemism, metaphor, reaction, pause)."
- "Back-to-back Tier 3 verbs are forbidden unless separated by natural language softening."

      example: "His hand lingered boldly, warmth pressing closer. She teased at his growing need."
    enforcement:
      - "Every intimacy line runs through L1 → L2 → L3 pipeline."

    euphemism_tokens: ["heat", "need", "desire", "fullness", "tremor", "pulse"]
    position_descriptors: ["on top", "from behind", "straddling", "leaning back", "kneeling"]
    enforcement:
      - "Tokens selected based on NPC traits, flirt style, and PunSys tier."
      - "Positions may be implied by description; explicit naming allowed if buffered."
      - "Slang never treadmill-repeated; distribution varies by character voice."
post_tier_3_rebound:
  definition: "Small, character-driven actions that follow peak intensity without flattening tone."
  examples:
    - "Clingier touch, teasing line, possessive gesture."
    - "Verbal switch-up to humor, softness, or assertiveness."
    - "Flashpoint foreshadow hint if unresolved tension remains."
  enforcement:
    - "Required after any Tier 3 spike unless interrupted by scene end or mutation."


  4.4_Foreplay_to_Fallout:
    flow:
      - "Foreplay detail (touch, tease, verbal pressure) builds weight."
      - "Climax cues trigger PunSys spike + possible flashpoint."
      - "Fallout/aftercare cools pressure, lowering tier toward 0/1."
    enforcement:
      - "At least one character-defining expression at climax (trait, quirk, or slang)."

# ============================================
Pillar_7_Flashpoint_Engine:

  7.0_Principles:
